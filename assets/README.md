## major_system_lookup_250k.csv

Precomputed dataset using create_dataset.py, contains about 250,000 words. The script ran for about 9 hours before it crashed, and generated more than 2 million entries. This dataset is limited to the first 250k. Both because of the file size constraints of github, and because the 250,000 most common words are probably enough anyways.
